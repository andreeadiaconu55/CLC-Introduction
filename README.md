# CLC-Introduction

## Objectives

- Usage and understanding of multiplexers and demultimplexers

## Designs description

- The creation of a comparator circuit: a Logic High '1' and Logic Low '0'(4 bits) enter the circuit, generating three exits, associeted with the results of comparison between parameters (<, =, >). The three exits are connected to three LED lights.
- The implementation of a function with the help of a multiplexer with three address lines, with a digital constant on 3 bits


## Elements learned
- Better understanding of CLCs
- Usage and understanding of digital constants
